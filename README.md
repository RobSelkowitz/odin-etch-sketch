Learning project to handle assorted DOM events and create DOM elements

Currently restricted to square grids by choice

I'd still like to add event logic to allow the mouse to move without
setting events in a "don't draw" mode to allow more precise drawing.

I might eventually update to allow more flexible color selection off
of a color palette.
